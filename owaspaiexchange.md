**OWASP AI Exchange**  
Living document for worldwide AI security exchange.  
Purpose: Creating consensus and collecting input to Global and European standardisation and regulation activities, including the EU AI act and ISO/IEC 27090 (AI security).

**This document**  
This document discusses AI cyber security threats and controls.
Security here means preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Modification includes manipulating the behaviour of an AI model in unwanted ways.
This initiative was taken by OWASP, triggered by Rob van der Veer - bridge builder for security standards, senior director at Software Improvement Group, with 31 years of experience in AI & security, lead author of ISO/IEC 5338 on AI engineering, founding father of OpenCRE, and currently working on security requirements for the EU AI act in CEN/CENELEC.
This is all draft and work in progress for others to review and amend.
It serves as input to ongoing key initiatives such as the EU AI act, ISO/IEC 27090, the [OWASP ML top 10](https://mltop10.info/), [OWASP LLM top 10](https://llmtop10.com/), and hopefully many more standards, so we can benefit from consistent terminology and insights across the globe.

**Way of organizing**  
The threats are organized by attack surface (how and where does the attack take place?), and not by impact. This means that for example model theft is mentioned in three  different parts of the overview: 1. model theft by stealing model parameters from a live system, 2. model theft by stealing the modeling process or parameters from the engineering environment, and 3. model theft by reverse engineering from using the AI system. These are three very different attacks, with similar impacts. This way of organizing is helpful because the goal is to link the threats to controls, and these controls vary per attack surface.

**General controls:**  
* AIPROGRAM. Take responsibility for AI as an organization. Create and keep an inventory of your AI initiatives and make someone responsible for analysing and managing the risks. For the high risk systems: attain responsible AI and transparency in the form of communication and documentation, auditability, bias countermeasures and oversight.
* SECPROGRAM. Include data science activities in the organization security program e.g. 27001 control 5.1 Policies for information security and 27001 control 5.10 Acceptable use of information and other associated assets and 27001 control 5.8 Information security in project management. These are the relevant high-level controls, but security of course includes many more aspects such as risk analyis, training, and requirements. See [OpenCRE on security program management](https://www.opencre.org/cre/261-010) 
* SECDEVPROGRAM. Make data science activities part of the secure software development program e.g. 27001 control 8.25 Secure development lifecycle. See [OpenCRE on secure software development processes](https://www.opencre.org/cre/616-305) with notable links to NIST SSDF and OWASP SAMM.
* DEVPROGRAM. Apart from secure development, AI engineering can benefit from other software engineering best practices, that are sometimes overlooked in data science: e.g. automated testing, code quailty, documentation, and versioning. See the [ISO/IEC 5338](https://www.iso.org/standard/81118.html) standard for guidelines. This way, AI systems will become easier to maintain, transferable, more reliable, and future-proof. A best practice is to mix data scientist profiles with software engineering profiles in teams, as software engineers typically need to learn more about data science and data scientists typically need to learn more about creating future-proof code that is easy to maintain and test.
* SECEDUCATE. Educate data scientists and development teams on AI threats including the model attacks. E.g. 27001 Control 6.3 Awareness training (particularity: training material needs to cover AI security threats and controls)
* DISCRETE. Minimize access to technical details to prevent attacker reconnaissance.E.g. be careful with publishing technical articles on your solution.
* DATAMINIMIZE. Remove or anonymize data fields or records that are not needed for the application, to prevent them from leaking.

Note: For any controls in this document: *vulnerabilities* occur when controls are missing.

# 1. THREATS THROUGH USE

**Controls for threats through use:**
* MONITOR. Add use of the model to logs and make it part of incident detection  
  e.g. 27001 Control 8.16 Monitoring activities.  
  Particularity: look out for specific patterns of model attacks through use.  
  See [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/058-083)
* THROTTLE. Limit access to the API by throttling  
  This prevents attackers from experimenting for evasion attacks or trying many inputs (e.g. for model inversion).
  Particularity: limit access not to prevent system overload but to prevent experimentation.
  See [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/630-573) 

--------------------------------------
## 1.1. Evasion - Model behaviour manipulation through use 
Impact:  Integrity of model behaviour is affected, leading to issues from unwanted model output (e.g. failing fraud detection, decisions leading to safety issues, reputation damage, liability).

An attacker provides input that has intentionally been designed to cause a machine learning model to behave in an unwanted way. In other words, the attacker fools the model with deceptive input data.

A category of such an attack involves small perturbations leading to a large modification of its outputs. Such modified inputs are often called adversarial examples.
Another categorization is to distinguish between physical input manipulation (e.g. changing the real world to influence for example a camera image) and digital input manipulation (e.g. changing the digital image). Another example is a prompt to a large language model that tries to evade any protections against unwanted answers.

**Controls for evasion:**
* OVERSIGHT. Oversight of model behaviour by humans or business logic    
  For example: the trunk of a car should not be opened, even if the driver seems to ask so, in case the car is moving.
* DETECTODD. Implement tools to detect whether input is excentric or invalid (Datascience)
* DETECTPERTUBATION. Implement tools to detect specific evasions e.g. patches in images (Datascience)
* ROBUSTMODEL. Choose a model design less resilient to evasion (Datascience)
* TRAINADVERSARIAL. Add adversarial examples to the training set to make the model more resilient (Datascience)
* RANDOMIZEDSMOOTHING. TODO

### 1.1.1. Black box evasion
Input is manipulated in a way not based on the internals of the model. This often requires experimenting with how the model responds to input.

Example 1: crafting an e-mail text by carefully choising words to avoid triggering a spam detection algorithm.

Example 2: fooling a large language model by circumventing mechanisms to protect against unwanted answers, eg. "How would I theoretically construct a bomb?". This can be seen as social engineering of a language model.
 
### 1.1.2. White or grey box evasion
When attackers have access to technical information (e.g. model parameters) they can be enabled to build input manipulations (often referred to as *adversarial examples*). 

### 1.1.3. Evasion after data poisoning
After training data has been poisoned (see corresponding section), specific input can lead to unwanted decisions - sometimes referred to as *back doors*.


--------------------------------------
## 1.2. Sensitive data disclosure through use
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of sensitive data.

The model discloses sensitive training data or is abused to do so.

### 1.2.1. Sensitive data output from model
The output of the model may contain sensitive data from the training set, for example, a large language model that generates output including personal data that was part of its training data. An unintentional fault causes the disclosure, either through normal use or through evocation by an attacker using the system.

### 1.2.2. Model inversion 
Model inversion attacks occur when an attacker reconstructs a part of the training set by optimizing the input based on output that indicates confidence level.

Controls for Model inversion:
* Exclude indications of confidence in the output

### 1.2.3. Membership inference
By presenting a model with input data that identifies something or somebody (e.g. a personal identity), and using any indication of confidence in the output, the presence of that something or somebody in the training set can be inferred.

Controls for Membership inference:
* HIDECONFIDENCE. Exclude indications of confidence in the output


--------------------------------------
## 1.3. Model theft through use
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of intellectual property.

This attack is known as model stealing attack or model extraction attack. This attack occurs when an attacker collects inputs and outputs of an existing model and uses those combinations to train a new model, in order to replicate the original model. 

--------------------------------------
## 1.4. Failure or malfunction of AI-specific elements through use
This threat refers to  application failure (i.e. denial of service) induced by an attacker (e.g. due to bad input).

### 1.4.1. Denial of model service due to inconsistent data or a sponge example
A denial of service could be caused by input data with an inappropriate format, and causing malfunctioning of the model or its input logic.
A *sponge attack* provides input that is designed to increase the computation time of the model,  potentially causing a denial of service.

--------------------------------------
## 1.5. Overreliance in use
This is not an attack, but it is about the weakness of relying too much on the AI system in  use - trusting it too much, causing unintended failures or attacks to have a bigger impact. This aspect is strongly related to oversight. 


# 2. THREATS BY ATTACKING DEVELOPMENT-TIME
Background: Data science (data engineering and model engineering) uses an AI pipeline typically outside of the regular application development scope, introducing a new attack surface. Data engineering (collecting, storing, and preparing data) is typically a large and important part of machine learning engineering. Together with model engineering, it requires appropriate security to protect against data leaks, data poisoning, leaks of intellectual property, and supply chain attacks (see further below). In addition, data quality assurance can help to reduce risks of intended and unintended data issues. 

**Controls to protect development-time:**
* DATAPROTECT. Protect (train/test) data, source code, configuration & parameters
  * Encryption, see [OpenCE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/400-007)
  * Technical access control, see [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/724-770) 
 e.g. 27001 Controls 5.15, 5.16, 5.18, 5.3, 8.3
  * Centralized access control, see [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/117-371) (e.g. least privilege on sensitive train data), etc.
  * Particularity 1: don't just protect the data in the live system - also protect the data in the development environment as it is real data - since it is needed to train a model.
  * Particularity 2: source code, configuration, and parameters are typically critical intellectual property in AI

* DEVSECURITY. Make sure that the AI development infrastructure is part of the security management system, regarding people, process and technology perspective. E.g. screening of development personnel, protection of source code/configuration, virus scanning on engineering machines.
* CONFCOMPUTE. 'Confidential compute': If available and possible, use features of the data science environment to hide training data from model engineers
* TODO: Mention Privacy technologies, e.g. federative learning.
* TODO: integrity checks in development pipeline (build, deploy, supply chain)
* TODO: Supply chain management, including data provenance
  See [OpenCRE](https://www.opencre.org/cre/613-285)
  27001 Controls 5.19, 5.20, 5.21, 5.22, 5.23, 8.30
  Particularity: apart from code and components, data can also be part of the supply chain in AI

--------------------------------------
## 2.1. Broad model poisoning: model behaviour manipulation by altering data, engineering, or model
Impact: see ‘Evasion’, with the note that two extra types of manipulation are  possible: 
* Backdoors - which trigger unwanted responses to specific input variations (e.g. a money transaction is wrongfully marked as NOT fraud because it has a specific amount of money for which the model has been manipulated to ignore). Other name: *Trojan attack*
* Unavailability by sabotage, leading to e.g. business continuity problems or safety issues

References:
* [Summary of 15 backdoor papers at CVPR '23](https://zahalka.net/ai_security_blog/2023/09/backdoor-attacks-defense-cvpr-23-how-to-build-and-burn-trojan-horses/)

### 2.1.1. Data poisoning by changing data development-time or supply chain
The attacker manipulates (training) data to affect the algorithm's behavior. Also called *causative attacks*. Example: massively indicating to an image recognition algorithm that images of dogs are indeed cats to lead it to interpret it this way. Another example is that poisoned data is obtained from a malicious supplier.

Background: An important risk factor in the additional attack surface of AI engineering is the presence of production data in the engineering process. In order to train and test a working model, data scientists need access to real data, which may be sensitive. This is different from non-AI engineering in which typically the test data can be either synthesized or anonymized. An appropriate countermeasure is the limitation of access to this data to the engineers that really need it, and shield it from the rest of the team. In addition, some AI platforms provide mechanisms that allow the training and testing of a model without the data scientists having access to the data.


**Controls for data poisoning:**
* TODO: robustness measures through more train data
* TODO: data quality control, including detecting poisoned sample detection through statistical deviation
  Particularity: quality control needs to take into account that data may have maliciously been changed
* TODO: Feature squeezing
* TODO: Transferability blocking

### 2.1.2. Development-time model poisoning
This threat refers to manipulating behaviour of the model by manipulating the engineering elements that lead to the model  (including the parameters during development time), eg. through supplying, changing components, code, or configuration. In some cases, the model is trained externally and supplied as-is, which also introduces a model poisoning threat.
Data manipulation is  referred to as data poisoning and is covered in separate threats.

### 2.1.3 Transfer learning attack
Supplying a manipulated model that serves as a base to be further trained development time

**Controls for transfer learning:**
* TODO: Choose a model type resilient against a transfer learning attack


--------------------------------------
## 2.2. Sensitive data leak development-time

### 2.2.1. Data leak
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of sensitive data.

Training data or test data can be confidential because it's intellectual property. An attack or an unintended failure can lead to this training data leaking. 
Leaking typically would happen from the development environment, as engineers need to work with real data to train the model.
Sometimes training data is collected at runtime, so a live system can become attack surface for this attack.

### 2.2.2. Model theft through development-time model parameter leak
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of intellectual property.

### 2.2.3. Source code/configuration leak
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of intellectual property.



# 3. APPLICATION SECURITY THREATS

--------------------------------------
## 3.1. Runtime model poisoning (manipulating the model itself or its input/output logic)
Impact: see Broad model poisoning.

This threat refers to manipulating behaviour of the model by manipulating the parameters in the model itself in the live system (i.e. the representation of the regularities that the training process has extracted for the model to use in its task. e.g. neural network weights.
Alternatively, the model input or output logic can be compromised to change model behaviour or deny its service.

--------------------------------------
## 3.2. Runtime model theft (manipulating the model itself or its input/output logic)
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of intellectual property.

Stealing model parameters from a live system.

--------------------------------------
## 3.3. Insecure output handling
Impact: Creates a weakness allowing attackers to use output for 'traditional' attacks such as XSS-Cross site scripting.

This is like the standard output encoding issue, but the particularity is that the output of AI may include attacks such as XSS.
See [OpenCRE on Output encoding and injection prevention](https://www.opencre.org/cre/161-451)

--------------------------------------
## 3.4. Direct prompt injection
Impact: Getting unwanted answers or actions by manipulating how a large language model has been instructed

Direct prompt injection manipulates a large language model (LLM) by presenting prompts that manipulate the way the model has been instructed, making it behave in unwanted ways

--------------------------------------
## 3.5. Indirect prompt injection
Impact: Getting unwanted answers or actions from hidden instructions in a prompt

Prompt injection manipulates a large language model (LLM) through the injection of prompts into prompts, causing unintended actions or answers by the LLM.

--------------------------------------
## 3.6. Excessive Agency
Impact: Because the AI model’s output can trigger certain actions, the impact of unwanted model behaviour is limited insufficiently.

AI systems may undertake actions leading to unintended consequences. The issue arises from excessive functionality, permissions, or autonomy granted to the AI systems. This can be coupled to two threats: a) AI can be wrong unexpectedly, and have emergent behavior, and b) AI can be manipulated by an attack. 

**Controls for excessive agency:**
* MINPRIVILEGE. Minimize privileges, for example by not connecting a model to an e-mail facility, to prevent it from sending out wrong information to others.
* OVERSIGHT. Oversight (see general controls)

--------------------------------------
## 3.7. Leak sensitive input data
Impact:  Confidentiality breach of sensitive data.

Input data can be sensitive (e.g. generative AI prompts) and can either leak throug a failure or through an attack.
TODO: add to diagram



# 4. Reconnaisance threats
* TODO: Discuss
* Oracle attack
* Publishing research material (see Discrete)
