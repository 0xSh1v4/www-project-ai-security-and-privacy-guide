# OWASP AI Exchange & OWASP AI security and privacy guide
Welcome to the GitHub repository for two initiatives:
1. The OWASP AI Exchange, to be found at [owaspai.org](http://owaspai.org): the living document owaspaiexchange.md that collects AI threats and controls from collaboration between experts worldwide.
2. The OWASP 'AI security and privacy guide' project, to be found at [index.md](index.md), which is published automatically at [owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/#](https://owasp.org/www-project-ai-security-and-privacy-guide/#). It holds a stable version of the AI Exchange, adds some illustrations and explanations for a wider audience, plus it has an additional section on the topic of AI privacy.
